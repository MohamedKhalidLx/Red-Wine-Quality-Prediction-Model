# Wine Quality Prediction with Python

This GitHub project aims to develop a machine learning model in Python that predicts the quality of wine based on various input features. The project is a collaborative effort by Adham and Ziad, who have worked together to create an accurate and efficient solution.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the quality of wine based on a set of input variables. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains information about different chemical properties of wines, such as acidity, pH levels, alcohol content, and more. By analyzing these features, the machine learning model will be able to predict the quality of the wine.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. The main components of the project include:

1. **Data**: The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the `data` directory. It contains a CSV file named `wine_quality.csv`, which holds the wine-related features and the corresponding quality ratings.

2. **Notebooks**: The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the various stages of the project. These notebooks provide step-by-step explanations and code snippets, making it easy to understand and reproduce the project.

3. **Scripts**: The `scripts` directory holds Python scripts that are used in the project. These scripts include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

4. **Models**: The `models` directory contains saved trained models in a serialized format. These models can be loaded for further analysis or used for making predictions on new data.

5. **Documentation**: The `docs` directory includes relevant project documentation, such as API references, additional notes, and any other useful information.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes various Python libraries and packages, including but not limited to:

- Pandas
- NumPy
